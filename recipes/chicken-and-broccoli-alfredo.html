  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A creamy white sauce, long strands of pasta mixed with tender pieces of lean protein along with broccoli. This is an old and simple recipe. The Italian restaurateur Alfredo Di Lelio doubled the amount of butter used. Alfredo invented his recipe in 1908 in the “trattoria” run by his mother Angelina in Rome, Piazza Rosa.</p>
  <p>In U.S. cuisine, cream is used as a sauce base. it may be mixed with other ingredients such as broccoli, parsley, garlic, shrimp, or chicken. Fettuccine Alfredo has now become ubiquitous in Italian-style restaurants in the United States and internationally, although in Italy this dish is not popular at all, as wrongly believed, and it is better known if called "Fettuccine al burro" instead of "Fettuccine Alfredo".</p>
